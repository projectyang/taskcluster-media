# Logos


* `logo.svg` was recreated by dustin and is not Eli's original work, but should be functionally identical.
* `taskcluster.sketch` is the original sketch file by Eli, visible at https://sketch.cloud/s/3KgYj.
* `faviconLogo.svg`, `faviconLogoCompleted.svg`, `faviconLogoFailed.svg`, `faviconLogoRunning.svg` was based on the original logo and created for use as favicons representing task states.
