# Logos


* `brandLogo.svg` was recreated by dustin and is not Eli's original work, but should be functionally identical.
* `taskcluster.sketch` is the original sketch file by Eli, visible at https://sketch.cloud/s/3KgYj.
* `logo.svg`, `logoCompleted.svg`, `logoFailed.svg`, `logoRunning.svg` was created for use as favicons representing task states.
